# Chapter 8: Creating an App's Navigation

In Chapter 8, I practice navigation techniques in Flutter to build user-friendly and intuitive apps. I learn how to use the Navigator widget to have smooth page transitions for seamless navigation throughout the app. I also learn about hero animations that allow widgets to transition dynamically from one page to another and add some visually appealing effects.

I also delve into creating a BottomNavigationBar with BottomNavigationBarItems, which are shown using icons and titles to simplify navigation between key sections. To make this even better, I utilize the BottomAppBar widget in order to design customizable navigation bars that contain advanced features such as notches for FloatingActionButtons.

For tabbed navigation, I implement TabBar and TabBarView, where the user can navigate between different views through a horizontal row of tabs and their associated content.

Lastly, I add the Drawer widget to add a sliding side menu and the ListView widget to efficiently build scrollable lists. By combining ListView with Drawer, I create functional menu lists that enhance app accessibility and usability.
